For us, a courier is not just someone with a package, but a representative of our service and a valued part of the team.\n\nWe promote:\n- a positive attitude,\n- politeness,\n- honesty and punctuality.\n\nAt the same time, we don‚Äôt turn a blind eye to violations.\nIf a courier:\n- breaks service rules,\n- ignores instructions,\n- or behaves rudely or inappropriately ‚Äî\n\nwe respond strictly. Each case is reviewed individually. We conduct an internal investigation, gather feedback from all parties, and, if necessary, revoke the courier‚Äôs access to the platform."

We recommend preparing a safe location in advance, especially if the order contains valuable or perishable items.\n\nIdeally, you have:\n- a video doorbell,\n- a security camera,\n- or someone to receive the package for you."
